# Tiel Standard Configuration
This repository contains configuration scripts for applying a custom, consistent, and opinionated base Arch Linux installation on top of a pre-installed [Archcraft OS](https://github.com/archcraft-os/archcraft/) experience. The idea is that the systems used by [Tiel](https://www.tiel.io/) should be simple and easy for everyone involved to setup and configure.

# Special Thanks
Special thanks is owed to the following organizations and people, without whose work this standard configuration would not be possible.
- [Arch Linux](https://www.archlinux.org/), a lightweight and flexible Linux distribution with an active and supportive community.
- [Aditya Shakya](https://github.com/adi1090x) for creating [Archcraft OS](https://archcraft-os.github.io/), a custom Linux distribution completely dependent on Arch Linux.
- [MrSorensen](https://github.com/mrsorensen) whose [reddit-wallpaper-downloader](https://github.com/mrsorensen/reddit-wallpaper-downloader) is included as a default experience in this standard configuration.
